            <pre>
                a. HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language 
                which is used for creating web pages and web applications. 
                
                b.  It is a very easy and simple language. It can be easily 
                understood and modified.

                c. It is very easy to make an effective presentation with HTML 
                because it has a lot of formatting tags.
                
                d. It facilitates programmers to add a link on the web pages 
                (by html anchor tag), so it enhances the interest of browsing of the user.

                <pre>
                   a. It is platform-independent because it can be displayed on any 
                   platform like Windows, Linux,and Macintosh, etc.
                   
                   b. It facilitates the programmer to add Graphics, Videos, and
                    Sound to the web pages which makes it more attractive and interactive.

                   c.  HTML is a case-insensitive language, which means we can use tags 
                   either in lower-case or upper-case.

        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Why HTML</h2>
        <p class="p-1 text-justify ">
            First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page contains several connections to other pages called
            hyperlinks. Every web page you see was written using one version of HTML. HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your Internet browser. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load
            images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance. One could think of HTML as the bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its skin (appearance).
